# CommunitySphere Application
_NCSU CSC547 Project by **Harish Rohan Kambhampaty** and **Soham Niranjan Sawant**_

CommunitySphere is a social networking platform inspired by Reddit, designed to facilitate user interactions through subreddits, user privileges, private messaging, live chat rooms, and multimedia content sharing.

This repository provides a method to test the responsiveness of dynamic scaling in Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the Minikube and Locust tests for the CommunitySphere application, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Locust](https://locust.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Start Minikube:

    ```bash
    minikube start
    ```

3. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t community-sphere:latest .
    ```

4. Deploy the application:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f mk-depl.yml
    ```

5. Deploy the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f mk-hpa.yml
    ```

6. Access the application:

    ```bash
    minikube service community-sphere
    ```

### Locust Load Testing

1. Install Locust:

    ```bash
    pip install locust
    ```

2. Start the Locust master:

    ```bash
    locust -f locust-file.py
    ```

3. Access the Locust Web UI at `http://localhost:8089` to configure the number of users, spawn rate, and start the test.
